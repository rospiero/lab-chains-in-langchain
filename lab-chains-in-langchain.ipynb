Some diseases, such as Ebola or certain strains of influenza, can be highly lethal and have caused significant outbreaks in the past. However, the severity of a disease is not solely determined by its mortality rate, but also by its impact on the affected individual's quality of life and the potential for widespread transmission. It is important to approach each disease with caution and understanding, and to continue research and prevention efforts to combat the most severe diseases.\""
